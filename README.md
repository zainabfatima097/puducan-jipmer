   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

## ⚙️ How It Works

### User Authentication Flow
1. User signs up/logs in via Firebase Authentication
2. Role assigned by admin determines dashboard access
3. User navigated to role-specific dashboard

### Patient Data Flow
1. **ASHA Worker** → Identifies patients in community
2. **Nurse** → Records vitals and clinical observations
3. **Doctor** → Reviews and prescribes treatment
4. **Admin** → Oversees all activities and generates reports

### Real-Time Updates
- All data changes instantly sync via Firebase Firestore
- TanStack Query caches results and invalidates when needed
- Components automatically re-render with latest data

---

## 🔧 Development

### Code Quality and Refactoring

The codebase is designed to be modular, maintainable, and scalable following modern software engineering principles.

#### Component-Based Architecture
- **Reusable Components:** UI broken into small, single-responsibility components, making code easier to understand, test, and maintain.
- **Generic Components:** Created reusable components like `GenericTable` and `GenericDialog`, reducing code duplication across the application.

#### Custom Hooks
- **Encapsulated Logic:** Custom hooks encapsulate and reuse logic for common tasks:
  - **`useAuth`:** Manages user authentication state and provides user information to components
  - **`useTableData`:** Fetches and manages data table operations including pagination, searching, and filtering
  - More hooks available for specific domain logic

#### Code Style and Linting
- **ESLint and Prettier:** Enforce consistent code style and catch potential errors early, ensuring clean and readable code.
- **Husky Pre-commit Hooks:** Automatically run linting and tests before each commit, preventing errors from entering the codebase.

---

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### 🚄 Performance Optimizations and Caching

The application is built with performance as a top priority, utilizing modern web technologies and best practices for a fast, responsive user experience.

#### Next.js Optimizations
- **Automatic Code Splitting:** JavaScript bundles are split into smaller chunks — users only download code needed for their page, reducing initial load time.
- **Image Optimization:** The `next/image` component automatically optimizes images, serving modern formats like WebP and resizing for different devices.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG):** Pages without real-time data (About, Contact) are pre-rendered at build time for instant loading.
- **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR):** Hybrid approach allowing static pages to update without full rebuilds.

#### Data Fetching and Caching with TanStack Query
- **Server-Side State Management:** **TanStack Query (React Query)** manages asynchronous data from Firestore with robust caching that reduces redundant API calls.
- **`staleTime` & `cacheTime`:** Queries serve cached data while re-fetching in the background, keeping UI responsive. `cacheTime` keeps data cached even when unused.
- **Query Invalidation:** When data updates (e.g., patient record edited), relevant queries are invalidated to trigger re-fetch and update UI with latest information.

#### Client-Side Caching and State Management
- **Zustand for Global State:** Lightweight global state management without the complexity of larger libraries, sharing state across components seamlessly.
- **`localStorage` for Form Data:** Form state is cached to prevent data loss during entry — reload the page and restore progress.

---

#### Summary: Key Caching Mechanisms
| Level | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Bundle** | Next.js Code Splitting | Reduce initial JS download |
| **Assets** | Image Optimization | Serve optimal image formats |
| **API Calls** | TanStack Query | Cache Firestore responses |
| **State** | Zustand | Share state across components |
| **Local Data** | localStorage | Persist form progress |
